    "Here are the key assumptions of the GLM:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is assumed to be linear. This means that the effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable is additive and constant across all levels of the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: The observations in the data are assumed to be independent of each other. This assumption implies that the value of the dependent variable for one observation does not depend on or influence the values of the dependent variable for other observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: The errors or residuals in the model have constant variance across all levels of the independent variables. This assumption is also known as the assumption of equal variance. Homoscedasticity ensures that the model is equally accurate in predicting the dependent variable at all levels of the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality: The errors or residuals in the model are assumed to be normally distributed. This assumption is necessary for valid hypothesis testing, confidence interval estimation, and parameter estimation in the GLM. It allows for valid statistical inference about the model coefficients and predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence of Errors: The errors or residuals in the model are assumed to be independent of the independent variables. This assumption implies that the errors are not correlated with the predictors or with each other."

    "The interpretation of the coefficients depends on the type of predictor variable and the link function used in the GLM.\n",

    "Continuous Predictors: For continuous predictors, the coefficient represents the change in the dependent variable associated with a one-unit increase in the predictor variable, holding all other predictors constant. For example, if the coefficient for a continuous predictor is 0.5, it means that, on average, a one-unit increase in the predictor is associated with a 0.5-unit increase in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical Predictors: For categorical predictors, the coefficient represents the difference in the dependent variable between the reference category (usually the baseline category) and the category specified by the coefficient. It indicates the average change in the dependent variable when comparing the specified category to the reference category, while holding other predictors constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Predictors: For binary predictors (coded as 0 and 1), the coefficient represents the difference in the mean of the dependent variable between the two categories. It indicates the average change in the dependent variable associated with a change from 0 to 1 in the binary predictor, while holding other predictors constant.\n",

    "In other words, the impact of one predictor on the dependent variable depends on the level or value of another predictor.\n",

    "Interaction effects can be present when the relationship between the dependent variable and one predictor varies across different levels or categories of another predictor. This indicates that the effect of one predictor is not constant but changes depending on the value or presence of another predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a study examining the effect of both age and gender on income. An interaction effect between age and gender suggests that the relationship between age and income differs for different genders. It implies that the effect of age on income is not the same for males and females. The presence of an interaction effect could mean that, for instance, older females have a different income pattern compared to older males.\n",

They allow for a more detailed understanding of how different predictors jointly influence the dependent variable and help avoid oversimplification of the relationships in the model.\n",

    "When interpreting a GLM with interaction effects, it is essential to consider the coefficients associated with the interaction terms. These coefficients quantify the additional effect on the dependent variable when the interacting predictors combine, beyond their individual effects. It is important to assess the statistical significance and interpret the direction and magnitude of these coefficients to understand the nature of the interaction."

It quantifies the degree to which changes in one variable correspond to changes in the other variable. The correlation coefficient, typically denoted by \"r,\" ranges from -1 to 1.
